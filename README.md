# SmallestDosProgarams
These are the two smallest programs (5 and 7 bytes) whitch I have written in 1995. and they were doing important tasks:
* NOSOUND turns off speaker whihc was sometimes left beeping after exiting some DOS game
* SETMODE3 resets graphics mode to text mode (80x25. 16 colors. 8 pages) after exiting some DOS games which left the 320x200 graphics mode on

Warning! *.com files are "compiled" executable files!
