# SmallestDosProgarams
These are the two smallest DOS programs (5 and 7 bytes) whitch I have wrote in 1995 to do important tasks for me:
* NOSOUND turns off speaker which was sometimes left beeping after exiting a DOS game
* SETMODE3 resets graphics mode to text mode (80x25. 16 colors. 8 pages) after exiting a DOS games which left the graphics mode on

Warning! *.com files are "compiled" executable files!
